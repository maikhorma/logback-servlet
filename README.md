# DO NOT USE THIS...yet
This project is in it's infancy. Please don't waste your time trying this. When it's ready I will remove this message.  *But..* if you're interested please add feature requests or whatever you can to give me some input.

# Goals
1. I want this to be a single servlet solution to add a logback control api to your application
2. As easy as possible to add to your project and communicate with it.  Anybody should be able to easily write a client for it whether it's within their web project, or some other application. This also includes proper documentation for all the use cases people may have.
3. Little or no transient dependencies, lightweight as possible (this + logback). *Please argue dependencies I should accept as I am willing to accept them if the benefit is worth it*. After thinking about this, I've decided I'd rather use existing tools to make progress, and then weed out dependencies that we can make up for without too much effort.  This will be a constant struggle with this application so any input is helpful.

# Step 0
First thing I will work on is to create a simple servlet that offers basic functions and returns json. Until this is proven, the "DO NOT USE THIS" message will be at the top of this readme.

# YOU
Here is what I'm hoping to get out of the community while I work on this:
1. Direction.  Are my goals in line with the community? What features are most important? What will it take to make you use this?
2. Contribution. I'm committing to getting something out there, but if the demand exceeds my capacity I will need contributions.
